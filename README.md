# Kannada MNIST
## by Thu Pham


## Dataset

>  Kannada is a language spoken predominantly by people of Karnataka in southwestern India. The language has roughly 45 million native speakers and is written using the Kannada script.
>  In this project, I will develop a classifier that will be used to predict which of the 10 digits is being written

## Important Findings

- In the 1st part, I built and trained an autoencoder model with 2 hidden encoder layers, 1 latent layer, and 2 hidden decoder layers. The validation loss is 0.0967 and the validation binary crossentropy is 0.0905.
- In the 2nd part, I built and trained a classifier model with encoder layers similar to the 1st part, but instead of decoder layers I added the classifier ones. The validation binary accuracy is 0.8209 and the Kaggle test accuracy is 0.9474.
